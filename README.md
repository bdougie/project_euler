Top secret project pending astonaut review

================
- The exercises were all approach differently. 
- After serval hours on exercise 3 and 5, I finally stumbled on some helpful methods in the Ruby Docs. I now know to look there first.
- Working with Algorthyms have been fun and I plan on working through the rest of these to massage my brain.
